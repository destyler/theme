# Destyler Theme

This is the [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) theme for the Destyler Documentation site.

## Development Setup

This repo can be developed on its own since it is a self-contained Starlight theme.
Make sure to use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager when installing deps.
A demo app is available in `/docs` and can be run with `pnpm dev`:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
